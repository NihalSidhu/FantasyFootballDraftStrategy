## Overview
Value over replacement is a fantasy football draft strategy created to help an owner draft players with the highest likelihood of being more valuable than the average starter. In this project, I look into how we can utilize 2023 NFL projections along with 2023 fantasy football average draft positions to help find the players are most valuable compared to the replacement (or average starter) for their respective position. This will allow an owner to follow a ranking system derived on how a player is valued amongst his counterparts. 

In order to create this value over replacement strategy, I utilizing my programming experience along with data analysis and visualization libraries. By leveraging both the data and my skillset, I am able to present the value over replacement rankings that can be used in fantasy football drafts.

## Skills & Tools
- Python
    - Libraries: Pandas & Seaborn
- Data Cleaning
- Data Modeling
- Model Development

## The Rankings
The project and process of how the value over replacement rankings were developed can be found here: [The Project](https://github.com/NihalSidhu/Value-Over-Replacement-FF-Strategy/blob/main/UsingDataInFantasyFootball.ipynb).

The final value over replacement rankings can be found here: [The Rankings](https://github.com/NihalSidhu/Value-Over-Replacement-FF-Strategy/blob/main/ValueOverReplacementRankings.csv).

## Acknowledgements
A big thank you to both FantasyPros and Underdog Network for having their data accessible to the public.
I was able to pull 2023 NFL projection data from the [Fantasy Pros Site](https://www.fantasypros.com/) and was able to get 2023 average draft position data from [Underdog Network](https://underdognetwork.com/football).
