## Overview
Value over replacement is a fantasy football draft strategy created to help an owner draft players based on who has the highest value compared to the average player. In this project, I utilize 2023 NFL projections along with 2023 fantasy football average draft positions to help find the players who are most valuable compared to the replacement (or average starter) in their respective position. The VOR draft strategy will allow an owner to follow a ranking system that can maximize their point total for their fantasy football team.

I designed and implemented the VOR draft strategy by utilizing my programming experience along with various data analytics libraries and visualization tools.

## Skills & Tools
- Python
    - Libraries: Pandas & Seaborn

This boxplot showcases how players' projections can be mapped across their own positions.

## Acknowledgements
A big thank you to both FantasyPros and Underdog Network for having their data accessible to the public.
I was able to pull 2023 NFL projection data from the [Fantasy Pros Site](https://www.fantasypros.com/) and was able to get 2023 average draft position data from [Underdog Network](https://underdognetwork.com/football).
